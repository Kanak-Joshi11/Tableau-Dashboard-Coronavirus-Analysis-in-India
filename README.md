# Tableau-Dashboard-Coronavirus-Analysis-in-India

**Project Overview** 
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Using Tableau, the dashboard visualizes COVID-19 case trends, vaccination rates, testing details, and demographic insights, allowing users to understand the pandemic's course from 2020-2022. The data visualizations are crafted to support both general viewers and health professionals in assessing trends and public health measures across Indian states.

**Objectives**
State-wise COVID-19 Cases: Visualization of confirmed, cured, and death cases by state to identify patterns and evaluate containment measures.
Vaccination and Testing Insights: Comparison of vaccination and testing coverage across states to reveal disparities and identify healthcare strengths and weaknesses.
Interactive Dashboard: An interactive Tableau dashboard enables users to filter by states, date range, and vaccination statuses for dynamic exploration of COVID-19 trends.

**Data Sources**
This dashboard utilizes four datasets from Kaggle:

Patient Information: Contains demographics and COVID status of individual patients.
COVID-19 Cases in India: Tracks cumulative case counts by state and time period.
State-Wise Vaccination Data: Details doses of Covaxin and Covishield administered per state.
State-Wise Testing Data: Provides state-level test counts, including positive and negative results.

**Key Visualizations**
COVID Cases by State: A line chart comparing confirmed, cured, and death cases across states, enabling a trend analysis by region.
Total COVID Deaths by State: A color-coded map to highlight states with high mortality rates, emphasizing the pandemic's geographic impact.
Testing Details by State: A bar chart showing total tests and breakdowns by positive and negative results.
Vaccination Totals by Vaccine Type: A bar chart displaying the count of Covaxin and Covishield doses administered nationwide.
Vaccination by Gender: A gender-based vaccination count to analyze demographic distribution in vaccine uptake.
Age Group Distribution of COVID-19 Cases: A pie chart illustrating the spread of cases across age groups, with the highest concentration among individuals aged 20-49.
